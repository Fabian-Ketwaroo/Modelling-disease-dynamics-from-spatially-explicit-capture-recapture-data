We performed a simulation study to assess the performance of the proposed modelling framework in estimating population
density and all other model parameters, as well as the impact on estimation when the effect of (local) population density on
transmission probability is ignored and, more importantly, when density dependent disease transmission, disease status and its
effect on other model parameters are ignored altogether. We refer to our proposed model as M(𝜓𝓁), to the model that does not
account for density-dependence in 𝜓 as model M(𝜓0) and to the standard open SCR model that does not account for density
dependence and disease status as model M(SRC0). We investigate model performance at both high and low density effects on disease transmission 


"Mlden_high.R", "mlden_low.R" -  M(𝜓𝓁) at high and low density effects respectively,

"Mpsi0_high.R", "Mpsi0_low.R" -  M(𝜓0) at high and low density effects respectively, and

"Mscr0_high.R", "Mpsi0_low.R" -  M(SRC0)) at high and low density effects respectively
