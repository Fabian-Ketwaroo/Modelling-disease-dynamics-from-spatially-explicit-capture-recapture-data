Modelling disease dynamics from spatially explicit
capture-recapture data


Abstract:

One of the main aims of wildlife disease ecology is to identify how disease dynamics
vary in space and time and as a function of population density. However, monitoring
spatio-temporal and density-dependent disease dynamics in the wild is challenging
because the observation process is error-prone, which means that individuals, their
disease status and their spatial locations are unobservable, or only imperfectly ob-
served. In this paper, we develop a novel spatially explicit capture-recapture (SCR)
model motivated by an SCR data set on European badgers (Meles Meles), naturally
infected with bovine tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis, TB). Our model accounts
for the observation process of individuals as a function of their latent activity centres,
and for their imperfectly observed disease status and its effect on demographic rates
and behaviour. This framework has the advantage of simultaneously modelling pop-
ulation demographics and disease dynamics within a spatial context. It can therefore
generate estimates of critical parameters such as population size; local and global
density by disease status and hence spatially-explicit disease prevalence; disease
transmission probabilities as functions of local or global population density; and de-
mographic rates as functions of disease status. Our findings suggest that infected
badgers have lower survival probability but larger home range areas than uninfected
badgers, and that the data do not provide strong evidence that density has a non-
zero effect on disease transmission. We also present a simulation study, considering
different scenarios of disease transmission within the population, and our findings
highlight the importance of accounting for spatial variation in disease transmission
and individual disease status when these affect demographic rates. Collectively these
results show our new model enables a better understanding of how wildlife disease
dynamics are linked to population demographics within a spatio-temporal context
